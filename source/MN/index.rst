Member Nodes Resources
======================

The `DataONE`_ website has links to several documents which describe DataONE and
questions for data entities to address when they are considering becoming a
Member Node.  A potential MN should review the following information to help
decide if a partnership with DataONE is appropriate.

* The `Member Nodes`_ page at `DataONE`_.

* `Member Node Fact Sheet`_

* `Member Node Partnership Guidelines`_

* The `Member Node Description Document`_, which is submitted as part of the
  proposal process.
