    "# Adjusting Custom Node Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Member Nodes generally control the content available in the Member Node document provided through the [/node](https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/node) service. This document describes custom properties that may be set by the Coordinating Nodes to augment the information provided by the Member Nodes. Such custom properties are not over-written by a Member Node when the Member Node registration information is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom properties set by the Coordinating Nodes MUST be prefixed by `CN_`. Such properties will be preserved through updates to the node registration. Note that the string \"CN_\" has no meaning other than to act as a mechanism for distinguishing custom properties from other properties that may be set by the MN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the custom property `${PROPERTY}` for the Member Node `${NODE_ID}` can be determined from the DataONE [list nodes API](https://releases.dataone.org/online/api-documentation-v2.0/apis/CN_APIs.html#CNCore.listNodes) with the following XPath statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "//node[identifier/text()='${NODE_ID}']/property[@key='${PROPERTY}']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using `curl` and `xmlstarlet`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "NODE_ID=\"urn:node:KNB\"\n",
    "PROPERTY=\"CN_date_operational\"\n",
    "curl -s \"https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/node\" | \\\n",
    "  xml sel -t \\\n",
    "  -m \"//node[identifier/text()='${NODE_ID}']/property[@key='${PROPERTY}']\" -v \".\"\n",
    "2012-07-23T00:00:0.000Z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in order to set any properties, the node must be registered. Furthermore, for the node to appear in the node list, it is necessary for the node to be approved. This is potentially problematic for nodes that are \"upcoming\" (i.e. `CN_operational_status = upcoming`) since such nodes should initially not be synchronizing. As such, it is necessary for an upcoming Member Node to be registered and approved, but with services flagged as being off. In order to prevent a node from accidentally setting node state to allow active harvesting, it is recommended that the initial node registration is created by a different subject to the node operator. This issue will be addressed in a later release of the infrastructure [#8058](https://redmine.dataone.org/issues/8058)."
