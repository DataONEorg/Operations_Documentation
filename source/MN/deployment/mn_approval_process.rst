Member Node Approval Process
============================

After reviewing DataONE literature and deciding that a partnership with DataONE would be beneficial to all parties, a Member Node will, working with project personnel, prepare a "proposal" including information about data holdings, scope of interaction with DataONE, etc.  
This includes completion of a `Member Node Description Document`_.
