====================

Implementers needing clarification or help using the tools or having technical 
problems have several ways to get their questions answered. DataONE has set up 
a ways to contact the development team.

Slack
-----

The developers maintain a virtual office of sorts, in that they join a dedicated
DataONE Slack_ channel for asking each other questions. Implementers are welcome to 
`join the discussion <https://slack.dataone.org/>`_, following the usual etiquette 
for online communication. Visit the ``#ci`` channel for technical topics.


ask.dataone.org
---------------

`ask.dataone.org`_ is a searchable compendium of questions and answers, based on the 
same model as stackoverflow. Especially if working off-hours, this could be the 
most direct way to get an answer, as it might already be answered, and if not,
allows you to post the question. Developers try to answer all questions within
a 48 hours.
