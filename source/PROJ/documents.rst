   * - Hackmd

       https://hpad.dataone.org

     - More advanced collaborative editor that uses markdown syntax and authentication 
       through GitHub. 

   * - Subversion Repository

       https://repository.dataone.org 

     - A subversion repository that contains technical documentation and source code.

   * - GitHub

       https://github.com/DataONEorg

     - A collection of Git repositories hosted by GitHub contains some documentation
       sources. This resource is limited by the size of content that may be stored.

   * - Redmine

       https://redmine.dataone.org/

     - The redmine issue tracker can be used to store documents as attachements, or 
       to add simple documents using the wiki (Markdown syntax).

   * - docs.dataone.org (DEPRECATED)

       https://docs.dataone.org/

     - Setup with Phase I of the DataONE project. This is a plone site that 
       is maintenance challenged. New content should not be added here, and 
       where appropriate, existing content should be migrated to another location.


Google Drive Notes
------------------

DataONE uses the public, generally available version of docs, and as a consequence there are some inconveniences to be aware of.

Duplicate files appear like some sort of duality paradox.
